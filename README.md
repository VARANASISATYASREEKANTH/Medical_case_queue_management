## 🔹 Key Features of Agentic AI in Medical Queue Management  

### 1️⃣ Intelligent Case Triage & Prioritization  
✔ **Real-time patient assessment** using AI-powered triage systems.  
✔ **Automatic prioritization** based on severity, medical history, and urgency.  
✔ **Dynamic reordering** of queues based on **emergency updates**.  
📌 *Example:* AI prioritizes **chest pain** cases over minor injuries in real-time.  

### 2️⃣ Predictive Wait Time Estimation  
✔ AI models predict **average wait times** based on **historical data, patient load, and staff availability**.  
✔ Provides **real-time updates** to patients and staff.  
📌 *Example:* AI predicts that a patient with a minor ailment will wait **45 minutes** while a critical case gets immediate attention.  

### 3️⃣ Automated Workload Balancing  
✔ **AI distributes cases** evenly across doctors, departments, and hospitals.  
✔ Detects **bottlenecks** and suggests **resource reallocation** (e.g., moving cases to nearby facilities).  
📌 *Example:* AI detects high congestion in ER and diverts stable cases to **urgent care centers**.  

### 4️⃣ Patient Communication & Virtual Assistance  
✔ AI-powered **chatbots** and **voice assistants** provide real-time case updates.  
✔ Allows **automated appointment rescheduling**.  
📌 *Example:* AI chatbot informs a patient if their case is delayed and suggests an alternative time.  

### 5️⃣ Proactive Emergency Detection & Alerts  
✔ AI monitors **vital signs, patient complaints, and health records** to detect **potential emergencies**.  
✔ Sends instant alerts to **doctors, nurses, and ambulance teams**.  
📌 *Example:* AI detects a worsening condition in a **waiting patient** and triggers an immediate intervention.
